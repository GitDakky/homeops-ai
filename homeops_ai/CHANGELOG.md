All notable changes to the GitDakky OpenClaw Home Assistant fork will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.20] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Expanded the README to show the full shipped feature set by area and kept the bundled OpenClaw version prominent so operators can see exactly what the add-on includes before installing or upgrading.

## [0.7.19] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Updated the bundled OpenClaw runtime from `2026.4.1` to `2026.4.2` so the add-on stays current with the latest upstream release.
- Updated the seeded operator prompt files so the default agent explicitly knows about `/ha-config`, the Home OS Memory store, and the dashboard Doctor / Memory surfaces.

## [0.7.18] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Added Home OS Memory v1 to the operator dashboard with a persistent house journal under `/config/.openclaw/home-os-memory/`, a first Doctor score, recent-change tracking from `/ha-config`, incident summaries, and a bounded risk register.

### Changed
- The ingress dashboard now includes a dedicated `Memory` tab that writes and reads the persistent house journal so operators can flick through what changed, what broke, and what still looks risky without leaving Home Assistant.

## [0.7.17] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Moved the embedded terminal to the top of the operator page and replaced the long scrolling layout with tabbed operator sections for overview, help, workspace, runtime, insights, and integrations.

## [0.7.16] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Reworked the operator landing page into a cleaner single-column dashboard with a denser tactical visual style, smaller typography, clearer alert coloring, and less layout shift during async status updates.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Matrix startup now fails closed when the add-on toggle is enabled without a homeserver or usable credentials. The add-on skips plugin installation in that state, logs one clear warning, and leaves the Matrix channel disabled instead of churning through blocked plugin bootstrap work.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Mounted the live Home Assistant config root into the add-on at `/ha-config` so the assistant can inspect and repair `configuration.yaml`, `secrets.yaml`, `custom_components/`, `packages/`, and `.storage/` in place.

### Changed
- Exported `HOME_ASSISTANT_CONFIG_DIR=/ha-config`, added a startup self-check for the mount, and surfaced the mounted config root in the dashboard/system-graph metadata.
- Updated the README, operator docs, landing page, and security guidance so `/config` remains the add-on workspace while `/ha-config` is clearly documented as the real Home Assistant config tree.

## [0.7.13] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Added a read-only Home Intelligence rack to the ingress dashboard with bounded homeowner, energy, system, predictive-maintenance, and security insight cards.
- Added Home Assistant snapshot heuristics in the local dashboard API so the add-on can summarize recent changes, top live loads, unavailable entities, low batteries, update backlog, unstable sensors, and security-relevant setting tradeoffs.

### Changed
- Updated README and DOCS to document the new operator insight cards as part of the shipped dashboard surface.
- Added explicit Assist-first setup guidance plus backlog/design artifacts for escalation policy and Janus media boundaries so future voice work stays bounded.

## [0.7.12] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- Tightened first-run operator guidance across the README, full docs, and ingress landing page so users pick the correct access path before testing the Gateway UI.
- Clarified that `gateway_public_url` is only the browser-facing launch URL while `gateway_remote_url` remains the backend `ws://` or `wss://` remote-gateway endpoint.
- Updated companion integration guidance so local add-on installs, `lan_https`, remote Home Assistant hosts, and `gateway_mode: remote` each point at the correct gateway path instead of implying the ingress page is a valid integration endpoint.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Added Matrix channel settings in the Home Assistant add-on configuration for homeserver URL, private-network allowance, bot user ID, access token or password auth, encryption, DM policy, room policy, room allowlist, and invite auto-join behavior.
- Added runtime wiring that configures `channels.matrix` in OpenClaw automatically from add-on settings and persists Matrix secrets under `/config/secrets/`.
- Added Matrix status visibility to the operator dashboard and system graph metadata.

### Changed
- The fork now defaults Matrix room handling to `groupPolicy=open` with `autoJoin=always` so users can invite the bot into rooms ad hoc without pre-whitelisting every room.
- Matrix direct messages still default to `pairing` so the low-friction room flow does not silently remove the safer DM boundary.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- This fork now disables OpenClaw exec approval prompts by default so Home Assistant automations and development flows no longer stop for human approval.
- The add-on now aligns both required policy layers with current OpenClaw guidance by forcing `/config/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json` defaults to `security=full`, `ask=off`, `askFallback=full` and setting `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json` to `tools.exec.host=gateway`, `tools.exec.security=full`, `tools.exec.ask=off`, and `tools.exec.strictInlineEval=false`.
- Operators can still turn `disable_exec_approvals` OFF manually if they explicitly want approval prompts restored.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- The add-on no longer starts the managed gateway with `--force`. Instead it clears any stale listener itself and then launches the plain `openclaw gateway` path that is known to work interactively in the Home Assistant terminal.
- When the managed runtime still exits unexpectedly, the add-on now prints the tail of `/tmp/openclaw/homeops-ai-runtime-wrapper.log` into the main add-on log so the actual gateway failure is visible without extra shell debugging.
- This targets the repeated boot-loop failure where the managed add-on startup exited with code `1` while a manual `openclaw gateway` command succeeded immediately on the same host.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- The add-on now launches the managed OpenClaw gateway with `OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1` so OpenClaw stays under one stable supervisor-owned PID inside the Home Assistant container instead of detaching into a fresh process tree.
- The runtime supervisor no longer tries to re-discover detached gateway children after startup; it now tracks the managed child directly and restarts it cleanly when onboarding or configuration changes require a recycle.
- This fixes the add-on-specific failure mode where `openclaw gateway` worked manually in the terminal but the automatically started gateway still died or appeared disconnected because the wrapper and OpenClaw were fighting over process supervision.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- The add-on now launches the managed OpenClaw runtime through `nohup` with stdin detached from the terminal and a dedicated wrapper log at `/tmp/openclaw/homeops-ai-runtime-wrapper.log`.
- This hardens automatic startup inside the Home Assistant add-on container and fixes the failure mode where the gateway could close immediately after launch even though the same `openclaw gateway --force` command worked manually from the terminal.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- The add-on now launches the local gateway with `openclaw gateway --force` instead of the less reliable `openclaw gateway run` wrapper.
- This aligns the managed startup path with the gateway entrypoint that works interactively in the add-on terminal and fixes the failure mode where the add-on could come up with no live gateway even though `openclaw gateway` started correctly by hand.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- The add-on now starts the local gateway with `openclaw gateway run --force` so stale listeners on the configured gateway port are cleared before the managed runtime launches.
- This fixes the post-update/startup failure mode where `openclaw tui` and `openclaw doctor` could still hit `unauthorized: gateway token mismatch` because an old listener on `127.0.0.1:18790` survived and kept rejecting the current token from `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Added a new add-on setting `github_issues_token` for a fine-grained GitHub token with Issues write access to `GitDakky/homeops-ai`.
- Added `oc-report-issue`, a bundled helper command that creates GitHub issues directly in this repository using the configured token.
- Added a bundled repo issue reporter skill so the seeded assistant knows how to turn operator bug reports and feature requests into structured GitHub issues for this fork.

### Changed
- The add-on now stores the GitHub issue token in `/config/secrets/github_issues.token`, exports repo issue reporting status to the dashboard, and shows the direct-reporting capability alongside Context7, Domotz, MQTT, BACnet, and Home Assistant MCP.
- Updated seeded agent guidance, README, and DOCS so operators know direct issue filing is available from inside the add-on when the token is configured.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Added managed terminal commands `oc-onboard` and `oc-configure` so onboarding and interactive reconfiguration can safely run inside the add-on without leaving the local gateway on stale auth.

### Changed
- The add-on now watches `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json` for gateway-runtime changes and triggers a managed local runtime recycle when onboarding or configuration rewrites gateway auth, bind, port, or related gateway settings.
- Updated setup and troubleshooting docs to point operators at the managed commands instead of raw `openclaw onboard` / `openclaw configure` inside the running add-on.

### Fixed
- Fixed the gateway token split-brain that could leave `openclaw tui` and the Control UI failing with `unauthorized: gateway token mismatch` after onboarding rewrote `openclaw.json` while the old gateway daemon was still alive.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Added a built-in Home Assistant MCP server inside the add-on image so OpenClaw can read live entities, devices, areas, labels, floors, automations, services, templates, and bounded history through first-class `ha_*` tools.
- Added new add-on options `enable_builtin_ha_tools` and `enable_ha_service_calls` so Home Assistant reads are available by default while mutating service calls remain opt-in.

### Changed
- Switched the add-on to register the local built-in Home Assistant MCP server automatically at startup instead of relying on the older manual `mcporter` flow for the normal case.
- Turned on `homeassistant_api` in the add-on metadata so the built-in tool layer can use Home Assistant's trusted internal API surface.
- Updated the seeded workspace guidance, README, DOCS, and translations so the agent and the operator both understand that live Home Assistant state is available as first-class tools by default.

### Notes
- The legacy `homeassistant_token` + `auto_configure_mcp` path still exists as a compatibility mode, but it is ignored when the built-in Home Assistant tool layer is enabled.

### Fixed
- Fixed a landing-page template bug that could leak a raw JavaScript fragment at the bottom of the operator page instead of rendering a clean Gateway button state.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Reduced manual local-network setup friction by making the landing page derive the Gateway Web UI URL automatically from the current Home Assistant host and access mode in the common local cases.
- Reframed `gateway_public_url` as an override for reverse-proxy, HTTPS, or Tailscale hostnames instead of something normal local installs should always have to fill in.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Added a seeded OpenClaw workspace bootstrap under `/config/clawd` with `AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `USER.md`.
- Added a GitDakky Home Assistant skill pack covering operations, automations, voice, diagnostics, file access, research, network mapping, MQTT, Domotz, and BACnet guidance.
- Added a local dashboard API and ingress UI panels for:
  - editing the seeded workspace and skill files
  - viewing live cron scheduler and heartbeat state
  - inspecting integration status for Context7, Domotz, MQTT, BACnet, and MCP
  - surfacing a lightweight SQLite-backed system graph
- Added new add-on options for Context7, Domotz, external MQTT brokers, and BACnet scout scaffolding.

### Changed
- The add-on now prepares secrets files for Context7, Domotz, and MQTT under `/config/secrets/` and exports their paths to the runtime so skills and automations can use them immediately.
- The image now bundles `sqlite3` and `mosquitto-clients` to support the new operator console and MQTT-oriented workflows.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Added a new add-on option `disable_exec_approvals` to force unattended host-exec policy for automation-heavy installs.

### Changed
- When `disable_exec_approvals` is enabled, the add-on now keeps `/config/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json` and `/config/.openclaw/openclaw.json` aligned by setting exec approvals to `security=full`, `ask=off`, `askFallback=full`, and `tools.exec.security=full` with `strictInlineEval=false`.
- When the option is disabled again, the add-on removes only the repo-managed approval overrides instead of clobbering unrelated user approval settings.
- Updated docs and Home Assistant option translations to explain the unattended exec policy and its risk tradeoff clearly.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Added a safer startup reconciliation path for legacy single-agent OpenClaw state so older `agent/` and `sessions/` layouts are migrated into `agents/main/...` before the gateway starts.
- Added a same-host device-pairing helper for local CLI/TUI operator requests on loopback-style installs to reduce spurious local `pairing required` failures.

### Changed
- Rebuilt the add-on landing page into a darker, more modern operator console while keeping the embedded terminal as a first-class section.
- Made bundled OpenClaw version rendering resilient by resolving it from the runtime, a build-time version file, or the CLI when the environment value is missing.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- Renamed the app to `HomeOps AI` and moved it to a fork-specific slug/image so it is clearly separate from the legacy add-on line.
- Replaced the app logo and icon with a GitDakky-specific lobster crest so the fork is visually distinct in the Home Assistant install list and sidebar.
- Updated install guidance for Home Assistant's current **Settings → Apps → Install App** flow.
- Added first-run migration logic to detect the legacy add-on, stop it before claiming host-network ports, and import its add-on config automatically when this fork starts with an empty config.
- Gave the fork its own default host-network ports (`18790`, `7682`, `48109`) so clean installs do not collide with the legacy add-on defaults.
- Switched the app configuration mounts to the current Home Assistant `map` object format and added access to `all_addon_configs` for legacy migration.

### Added
- Supervisor API access (`hassio_api`, manager role) so this fork can perform a controlled first-run migration from the old add-on.

### Notes
- This fork now publishes as `ghcr.io/gitdakky/homeops-ai`.
- Existing installs of this fork under the old slug will not be an in-place rename; Home Assistant will treat the new slug as a separate app.

## [0.5.67] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- Limited published add-on images to `amd64` and `aarch64` so the release pipeline matches Home Assistant's current supported builder targets.
- Fixed the GitHub Actions image publish workflow and kept the published image target at `ghcr.io/gitdakky/openclaw-assistant`.

### Notes
- `armv7` is no longer published by this fork. Home Assistant has moved away from `armv7`, and the current Home Assistant builder actions do not support publishing it. Keeping it listed would advertise an image we cannot release safely.

## [0.5.66] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- Bumped bundled OpenClaw from `2026.3.13` to `2026.4.1`, the newest upstream version currently published on npm.
- Moved the OpenClaw pin into a single Dockerfile build argument and added a build-time version smoke check.
- Surfaced the bundled OpenClaw version on the landing page and in the docs so users can verify what the image contains.
- Added maintainer documentation and CI validation to make future OpenClaw bumps safer and more repeatable.
- Migrated the add-on build off deprecated `build.yaml`, added a published image reference, and added a multi-arch GitHub Actions release workflow for `main`.

### Fixed
- `trusted-proxy` mode now removes incompatible shared token/password auth from `openclaw.json`, which OpenClaw 2026.4.x rejects at runtime.
- Switching back to token auth now re-generates a shared token automatically if a previous `trusted-proxy` run removed it.

## [0.5.65] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- Simplified the animated README SVG graphics so they render cleanly without layout collisions.
- Added a contribution-first README note that explicitly asks people to help via issues, docs, testing, or code instead of donations or sponsorship.

## [0.5.64] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- Repointed repository metadata and installation guidance to the `GitDakky/homeops-ai` fork so Home Assistant users land on the actively maintained repo.
- Rebuilt the repository README with animated SVG branding, a cleaner quick-start path, and no leftover raster showcase graphic.

## [0.5.63] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- Bump OpenClaw to 2026.3.13.

## [0.5.62] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Gateway restart loop** (issue #95): `openclaw gateway run` is a thin wrapper that spawns `openclaw-gateway` as a long-running daemon then exits immediately. On self-restart (SIGUSR1 / `openclaw gateway restart`), the old daemon forks a new one and exits — the new PID is not a child of run.sh. The supervisor now uses a 3-tier daemon detection function (`find_gateway_daemon_pid`): (1) port ownership via `ss -tlnp`, (2) process title via `pgrep -f "openclaw-gateway"`, (3) `/proc/*/cmdline` scan for "openclaw" (catches the daemon immediately after fork, even before process.title or port bind — critical on Pi/eMMC where initialization takes 20-30 s). Detection retries up to 10 times with a final port-occupancy guard before any supervisor-initiated restart. Non-child PIDs are monitored with `kill -0` polling instead of `wait`. The loopback relay (tailnet mode) is stopped/restarted around gateway restarts to prevent port conflicts.

## [0.5.60] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Session lock cleanup ignored non-default agents**: `cleanup_session_locks` was hardcoded to `agents/main/sessions`, skipping stale locks for any agent with a custom `forcedAgentId`. Stale locks could block the gateway from opening sessions for those agents, causing silent fallback to `main`. Cleanup now scans all `agents/*/sessions/` directories.

## [0.5.59] - 2026-03-10

- **Remote mode URL not propagated** (issue #93): `start_openclaw_runtime` was reading `gateway.remote.url` back via `openclaw config get`, which can time out (2 s limit at startup) or return an empty/redacted result. The function now uses `$GATEWAY_REMOTE_URL` directly from the already-parsed add-on options, which is the same value the config helper writes to `openclaw.json`.
- **Terminal CLI unreachable in tailnet mode** (issue #90): when `gateway_bind_mode=tailnet` (or `access_mode=tailnet_https`), the gateway binds only to the Tailscale IP. The local CLI always connects via `ws://127.0.0.1:PORT`, causing "Gateway not running" inside the add-on terminal. A lightweight loopback relay (Node.js) is now started automatically to forward `127.0.0.1:PORT → TAILSCALE_IP:PORT`, making all terminal CLI commands work normally. Token auth is still enforced end-to-end by the gateway.
- **Session lock cleanup ignored non-default agents**: `cleanup_session_locks` was hardcoded to `agents/main/sessions`, skipping stale locks for any agent with a custom `forcedAgentId`. Stale locks could block the gateway from opening sessions for those agents, causing silent fallback to `main`. Cleanup now scans all `agents/*/sessions/` directories.

### Added
- **MCP auto-configuration for Home Assistant**: new option `auto_configure_mcp` (default: `false`). When enabled and `homeassistant_token` is set, the add-on automatically registers Home Assistant as an MCP server (`mcporter config add HA ...`) on startup. Auto-detects the HA API URL (supervisor proxy or localhost:8123). Re-configures only when the token changes.
- Landing page: new collapsible **MCP setup** section with automatic and manual setup instructions, post-upgrade refresh command, and model tips.
- DOCS: new **MCP Integration** guide covering automatic/manual setup, verification, model requirements, and troubleshooting.

### Changed
- Bump OpenClaw to 2026.3.9.

## [0.5.58] - 2026-03-08

### Changed
- Bump OpenClaw to 2026.3.7.

## [0.5.57] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- New add-on option `controlui_disable_device_auth` (default: `true`) to control whether `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` is enabled in `lan_https` mode.

### Changed
- `set-control-ui-origins` helper now accepts an explicit device-auth toggle and applies `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` accordingly instead of forcing it on.
- `run.sh` now forwards the add-on option to the config helper.
- Control UI guidance text and docs were updated to explain when device-pairing bypass should be ON vs OFF.

### Fixed
- Docker build stability: replaced NodeSource `setup_22.x | bash` installer with explicit keyring + apt source configuration for Node.js 22, avoiding intermittent `apt-get install nodejs` exit code 100 failures.

### Translations
- Added `controlui_disable_device_auth` labels/descriptions to: `en`, `bg`, `de`, `es`, `pl`, `pt-BR`.

## [0.5.55] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- Bump OpenClaw to 2026.3.2.

## [0.5.54] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- Added startup guidance when `gateway_auth_mode=trusted-proxy` is enabled to clarify why direct local CLI gateway calls can show `trusted_proxy_user_missing`/unauthorized.
- Bump OpenClaw to 2026.2.24.

### Added
- New add-on option `gateway_additional_allowed_origins` for extra Control UI origins in `lan_https` mode.
- **Custom SANs in TLS certificate** (`lan_https` mode): hostnames and IPs from `gateway_additional_allowed_origins` and `gateway_public_url` are now included in the server certificate's Subject Alternative Name. The certificate auto-regenerates when SANs change.

### Fixed
- **Gateway token on landing page**: read token directly from `openclaw.json` instead of via `openclaw config get` which redacts secrets since OpenClaw v2026.2.22+ (fixes "Open Gateway Web UI" button sending `openclaw_redacted` as the token).
- **Token retrieval instructions**: all "get your token" references in the landing page and DOCS now use `jq -r '.gateway.auth.token' /config/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with a note explaining why the old `openclaw config get` command no longer works.
- `lan_https` startup no longer overwrites `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` with defaults only.
- Control UI origins are now merged as: built-in defaults + existing config values + `gateway_additional_allowed_origins` (deduplicated).
- In `lan_reverse_proxy` and other non-`lan_https` setups, Control UI origins now also include the origin derived from `gateway_public_url`.
- `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` configuration is now consistently applied via merge logic (defaults + existing values + user extras), reducing manual `openclaw.json` edits after upgrades.
- Add-on no longer exits/restarts when OpenClaw runtime process is restarted during onboarding or config changes.
- `run.sh` now supervises the OpenClaw runtime (`openclaw gateway run` / `openclaw node run`) and auto-restarts it while keeping nginx + terminal alive.

## [0.5.53] - 2026-02-24
- Bump OpenClaw to 2026.2.23.

## [0.5.52] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- New add-on option `gateway_env_vars` that accepts a list of `{name, value}` objects from Home Assistant UI and safely injects values into the gateway process at startup (max 50 vars, key <=255 chars, value <=10000 chars).
- Guard `gateway_env_vars` from overriding reserved runtime/proxy/`OPENCLAW_*` keys.
- Keep legacy string/object input formats for backward compatibility.

## [0.5.51] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **`web_fetch failed: fetch failed`**: changed `force_ipv4_dns` default to **true**. Node 22 tries IPv6 first; most HAOS VMs lack IPv6 egress, causing outbound `web_fetch` / HTTP tool calls to time out.

### Added
- **`nginx_log_level` option** (`minimal` / `full`, default `minimal`): suppresses repetitive Home Assistant health-check and polling requests (`GET /`, `GET /v1/models`, `POST /tools/invoke`) from the nginx access log.

## [0.5.50] - 2026-02-23

**[!WARNING!]**
This update contains lots of changes. It is adviced to backup before installing!

### Changed
- **Upgraded OpenClaw to v2026.2.22-2** — includes major gateway/auth/pairing fixes and security hardening.
- Precreate `$OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR/identity` on startup to prevent `EACCES` errors on CLI commands that need device identity.
- Gateway token is auto-constructed from detected LAN IP when `lan_https` is active and `gateway_public_url` is empty.
- Config helper now receives the effective internal port (gateway_port + 1 in lan_https mode).

### Notes — v2026.2.22 impact on this add-on
- **Pairing fixes (loopback)**: v2026.2.22 auto-approves loopback scope-upgrade pairing requests, includes `operator.read`/`operator.write` in default scope bundles, and treats `operator.admin` as satisfying other scopes. This greatly improves `local_only` mode reliability.
- **`dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` security warning**: v2026.2.22 now emits a startup warning when this flag is active. The warning is **expected and harmless** for `lan_https` mode — the flag is still required because LAN browser connections through the HTTPS proxy are not considered loopback by the gateway. Token auth remains enforced.
- **Gateway lock improvements**: stale-lock detection now uses port reachability, reducing false "already running" errors after unclean restarts.
- **Log file size cap**: new `logging.maxFileBytes` default (500 MB) prevents disk exhaustion from log storms.
- **`wss://` default for remote onboarding**: validates our HTTPS proxy approach as the correct direction.

### Added
- **Disk-space monitoring on the landing page** — shows total / used / available with colour-coded indicator (🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴).
- **Low-disk warning banner** appears automatically when usage exceeds 90 %.
- **`oc-cleanup` terminal command** — interactive helper that shows cache sizes (npm, pnpm, OpenClaw, Homebrew, pycache, tmp) and lets users reclaim space with a menu-driven cleanup.
- Startup disk-space check with log warnings when the overlay is above 75 % or 90 %.
- **`access_mode` preset option** — simplifies secure access configuration with one setting:
  - `custom` (default, backward-compatible): use individual gateway settings
  - `local_only`: loopback + token (Ingress/terminal only)
  - `lan_https`: **built-in HTTPS reverse proxy for LAN access** (recommended for phones/tablets)
  - `lan_reverse_proxy`: LAN bind + trusted-proxy for external reverse proxy (NPM, Caddy, Traefik)
  - `tailnet_https`: Tailscale interface bind + token auth
- **Built-in TLS certificate generation** (`lan_https` mode):
  - Auto-generates a local CA + server certificate on first startup
  - Server cert is regenerated automatically when LAN IP changes
  - CA certificate downloadable from the landing page for one-tap phone trust
  - nginx HTTPS server block terminates TLS and proxies to the loopback gateway
- **Overhauled landing page** with:
  - Real-time status cards (gateway health, secure context, access mode)
  - Access wizard with step-by-step guidance per mode
  - Error translation — maps raw errors like `1008: requires device identity` to friendly messages with fixes
  - CA certificate download button (lan_https mode)
  - Migration banner for users on `custom` mode recommending a preset
  - Collapsible reverse-proxy recipes (NPM / Caddy / Traefik / Tailscale)
- Added `openssl` to Docker image for TLS certificate generation.
- Translations for `access_mode` in all 6 languages (EN, BG, DE, ES, PL, PT-BR).

### Fixed
- **`lan_https` — error 1008 "pairing required"**: auto-set `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth: true` to skip interactive device pairing (token auth remains enforced). Replaces the invalid `pairingMode` key that caused `Unrecognized key` config errors.

# HomeOps AI — Documentation

HomeOps AI packages [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) as a proper Home Assistant add-on/app. It follows Home Assistant Supervisor lifecycle rules and uses Hermes-native concepts from the official documentation: <https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/>.

This add-on also ships the [Hermes Paperclip Adapter](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-paperclip-adapter) and [Hermes Workspace](https://hermes-workspace.com/) so Home Assistant users get the CLI agent, gateway/API surface, and browser workspace in one managed package.

The live Home Assistant configuration root is mounted at `/ha-config` for inspection and recovery. HomeOps/Hermes state persists under `/config/.hermes` and `/config/homeops`.

**Bundled Hermes Agent release:** `v2026.7.20`

## 1. Architecture Overview

### What runs inside the add-on

The add-on container runs three services:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Hermes Gateway** | 18790 (configurable) | The AI agent server — handles skills, chat, automations |
| **nginx** (Ingress proxy) | 48109 (fixed) | Serves the HomeOps AI landing page inside Home Assistant |
| **Hermes Workspace** | 3000 (configurable) | Browser workspace UI for Hermes sessions, skills, files, and operations |
| **Hermes Dashboard** | 9119 (proxied under HA Ingress `/dashboard/`) | Hermes Agent dashboard for config, sessions, skills, and in-browser chat |
| **ttyd** (Web terminal) | 7682 (configurable) | Browser terminal for `homeops-hermes`, `hermes config`, `hermes model`, and recovery |

When you open the add-on page in Home Assistant, nginx serves a landing page with:
- An **Open Hermes Workspace** button (opens Workspace in a new tab)
- An **Open Hermes Dashboard** button (available inside the Home Assistant add-on UI through Ingress)
- An embedded **terminal** for running commands

### Key directories

| Path | Persistent? | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `/config/` | Yes | All user data — survives add-on updates and rebuilds |
| `/config/.hermes/` | Yes | Hermes configuration (`hermes.json`), skills, agent data |
| `/config/homeops/` | Yes | Agent workspace (Hermes Skills-installed skills, files) |
| `/config/.node_global/` | Yes | User-installed npm packages (skills installed via dashboard) |
| `/config/secrets/` | Yes | Tokens (e.g., `homeassistant.token`) |
| `/config/keys/` | Yes | SSH keys (e.g., router SSH key) |
| `/config/.linuxbrew/` | Yes | Homebrew install and brew-installed CLI tools |
| `/config/gogcli/` | Yes | gog OAuth credentials for Google APIs |
| `/ha-config/` | Yes | The real Home Assistant config root: `configuration.yaml`, `secrets.yaml`, `custom_components/`, `packages/`, `.storage/` |
| `/usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/` | No | Hermes installation (rebuilt with each image update) |

> **Important**: Everything under `/config/` persists across add-on updates. The container filesystem (`/usr/`, `/opt/`, etc.) is rebuilt each time the image changes.
>
> **Important**: `/ha-config` is not another Hermes workspace. It is the live Home Assistant config tree. Changes there affect Home Assistant directly.

## 2. Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this repository.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGitDakky%2Fhomeops-ai)

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Apps**.
   - On some versions this is **Settings → Add-ons** or **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**.
2. Click the button above to open the repository-import dialog directly, or choose **Add repository** / **Add app repository** from the dashboard.
3. If you are adding it manually, paste:
   - `https://github.com/GitDakky/homeops-ai`
4. Return to the Apps/Add-ons list, select **HomeOps AI**, and click **Install**.
5. Open the **Configuration** tab before first start and review the runtime/access options.
6. Click **Start**.
7. Open the HomeOps AI page from the Home Assistant sidebar/add-on page.

**Supported architectures**: amd64, aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5)

> **Important**: install HomeOps AI through the Home Assistant dashboard / Supervisor repository flow. Do not SSH into HAOS and install Hermes manually inside the host OS. Home Assistant can reset unsupported non-native applications, while add-on-managed state under `/config` persists correctly.

### Migration from the legacy add-on

If the original `homeops_ai` add-on is installed, this fork will try to:

1. detect the legacy add-on via the Supervisor API
2. stop it before claiming host-network ports
3. import its add-on config from `/addon_configs/<legacy_repo>_homeops_ai`
4. reuse its saved Hermes runtime state on the first boot of this fork

For clean installs, this fork uses its own default host-network ports so it does not collide with the legacy line before migration runs:
- gateway: `18790`
- terminal: `7682`
- ingress: `48109`

If automatic migration fails, stop or uninstall the old add-on before starting this fork.

---

## 3. First-Time Setup

### What happens on first boot

When the add-on starts for the first time, it automatically:
1. Creates persistent directories under `/config/`
2. Generates a minimal `hermes.json` with a random gateway auth token
3. Syncs built-in skills to persistent storage
4. Starts the gateway, terminal, and nginx
5. Verifies that `/ha-config/configuration.yaml` is reachable and logs a warning if the Home Assistant config mount is missing

### Before you open the Gateway UI

Pick the access path first so the first browser test matches the actual runtime wiring:

1. If you are starting on the same Home Assistant host or just using the embedded terminal, the default local path is fine.
2. If you want to use a phone, tablet, or another LAN browser, set `access_mode` to **lan_https** and restart before you test the button.
3. If you are using a reverse proxy or Tailscale hostname, set the matching `access_mode` first and only set `gateway_public_url` when the browser-facing host differs from the Home Assistant host.
4. If you are using `gateway_mode: remote`, keep `gateway_remote_url` as the backend `ws://` or `wss://` endpoint. Set `gateway_public_url` separately only if you want the landing page button to open a browser-facing `http://` or `https://` Control UI URL.

### Step 1 — Run onboarding

Open the add-on page in Home Assistant. You'll see a landing page with an embedded terminal.

In the terminal, run:

```sh
homeops-onboard
```

This interactive wizard walks you through connecting your AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.) and basic configuration.

`homeops-onboard` is the add-on's managed onboarding wrapper. It runs the normal `hermes onboard` flow, then automatically restarts the local Hermes runtime if onboarding changed gateway auth or other runtime-critical config. Use it instead of raw `hermes onboard` inside this add-on.

> **Note (v0.5.54+)**: If onboarding triggers a gateway runtime restart, the add-on now keeps nginx/terminal alive and auto-recovers the runtime instead of restarting the whole container.

Alternatively, for more granular control:

```sh
homeops-configure
```

`homeops-configure` is the managed equivalent of `hermes configure`. It protects the running gateway from stale in-memory auth/config after interactive changes.

### Step 2 — Get your Gateway token

The gateway requires a token for authentication. To retrieve it:

```sh
jq -r '.gateway.auth.token' /config/.hermes/config.yaml
```

> **Note**: Since Hermes v2026.2.22+ `hermes config get` redacts sensitive values (returns `hermes_redacted`). Read the token directly from the config file with `jq` as shown above.

Save this token — you'll need it to access the Hermes Workspace and for API integrations.

### Step 3 — Verify everything works

1. In the terminal, confirm the gateway is running:
   ```sh
   hermes gateway status
   ```
2. Click the **Open Hermes Workspace** button on the landing page
3. If prompted for a token, paste the one from Step 2 or go to the Overview tab, paste the token in the 'Gateway Token' field and press Connect.

---

## 4. Accessing the Hermes Workspace

The Hermes Workspace (Control UI) is Hermes's main web interface. It opens in a **separate browser tab** because Home Assistant's Ingress proxy has WebSocket limitations.

> **Important (v2026.2.21+):** Hermes now requires a **secure context** (HTTPS or localhost) for the Control UI. Plain HTTP over LAN is no longer accepted. The add-on's `access_mode` option makes this easy — see below.
>
> **v2026.2.22 note:** The gateway now emits a startup security warning when `dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` is active (used by `lan_https` mode). This warning is **expected and safe to ignore** — token authentication is still enforced.

### Choosing an access mode

Set `access_mode` in **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Configuration**:

| Mode | Best for | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **`lan_https`** | Phones, tablets, LAN browsers | Adds a built-in HTTPS proxy inside the add-on. No external setup needed. |
| **`lan_reverse_proxy`** | Users with NPM / Caddy / Traefik | Binds gateway to LAN; your proxy terminates TLS. |
| **`tailnet_https`** | Tailscale users | Binds to Tailscale interface; use Tailscale HTTPS certs. |
| **`local_only`** | Terminal/Ingress only | Loopback — gateway not reachable from other devices. |
| **`custom`** | Advanced / backward compat | Uses the individual `gateway_bind_mode` / `gateway_auth_mode` settings. |

### Method A — Built-in HTTPS proxy (`lan_https` — recommended)

This is the simplest way to get secure LAN access, especially for phones and tablets.

1. Go to **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Configuration**
2. Set `access_mode`: **lan_https**
3. Restart the add-on

**What happens automatically:**
- The add-on generates a local CA certificate and a TLS server certificate
- nginx listens on the gateway port (default 18790) with HTTPS on all interfaces
- The gateway process itself binds to loopback on an internal port (gateway_port + 1)
- The landing page shows a **Download CA Certificate** button

**Phone/tablet setup (one-time):**
1. Open the add-on page in HA and click **Download CA Certificate**
2. Install the certificate on your device:
   - **Android**: Settings → Security → Install certificate → CA certificate → select file
   - **iOS**: Open the `.crt` file → Install Profile → Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings → enable the Hermes CA
3. After installing the CA, your browser will trust the gateway without warnings

> **Note**: If you skip CA installation, you can still access the gateway — just accept the browser's certificate warning once.

### Method B — HTTPS via external reverse proxy (tested recipe: NPM)

Use this when you already run Nginx Proxy Manager (or Caddy/Traefik).

**Hermes add-on settings**
1. Set `access_mode`: **lan_reverse_proxy**
2. Set `gateway_trusted_proxies` to your proxy source CIDR/IP.
   - Example for NPM add-on network: `172.30.0.0/16`
   - Or strict single IP: `172.30.x.y/32`
3. Set `gateway_public_url` to your final HTTPS URL (example: `https://hermes.example.com`)
4. Restart Hermes add-on

**NPM host config (known-good pattern)**
1. Create Proxy Host: `hermes.example.com`
2. Forward to: `http://<HA-LAN-IP>:18790`
3. Enable **Websockets Support**
4. SSL tab: request/attach certificate, enable **Force SSL**
5. Add custom header for trusted-proxy auth:
   - `X-Forwarded-User: hermes`

Then open `https://hermes.example.com`.

> **Important**: Nabu Casa remote access only proxies port 8123. It does not expose custom add-on ports directly.

### Method C — SSH port forwarding (secure, no config changes)

Forward the gateway port from your HA host to your local machine:

```sh
ssh -L 18790:127.0.0.1:18790 your-user@your-ha-ip
```

Then open `http://localhost:18790` in your browser. `localhost` counts as a secure context.

> **Limitation**: SSH forwarding doesn't work on phones/tablets. Use `lan_https` for mobile access.

### Method D — Tailnet flow (tested with HA Tailscale add-on + NPM)

This is the practical flow users report as stable in HAOS.

1. In **Tailscale add-on**:
   - Disable `userspace_networking` (must be `false` so other add-ons can reach tailnet interface)
2. In **Hermes add-on**:
   - Preferred: set `access_mode` to **tailnet_https**
   - Alternative (equivalent): `gateway_bind_mode: tailnet`, token auth
3. In **NPM**:
   - Forward target to `http://<HA-TAILNET-IP>:18790`
   - Enable websockets
   - Configure TLS cert on the public host
4. Set `gateway_public_url` to the final HTTPS URL and restart Hermes

> **Why this flow**: `tailnet_https` in this add-on is a bind/auth preset. It does not automatically run `tailscale serve` inside Hermes.

### Setting up the "Open Hermes Workspace" button

In most local installs you can leave `gateway_public_url` empty. The add-on now tries to derive the correct Gateway URL automatically from the Home Assistant host and access mode. Set `gateway_public_url` only when the externally reachable hostname differs from the host you are already using in Home Assistant.

**Use the right field for the right job:**
- `gateway_remote_url` is for backend remote-gateway connectivity and should stay `ws://` or `wss://`.
- `gateway_public_url` is only for the browser launch URL shown on the landing page and should be `http://` or `https://`.
- Do **not** paste a websocket URL into `gateway_public_url`.

**Examples**:
- LAN HTTPS (built-in): `https://192.168.1.119:18790`
- External HTTPS: `https://hermes.example.com`
- Tailscale: `https://ha-machine.ts.net:18790`

> **Tip**: In current releases, the add-on first tries the current Home Assistant hostname for the Gateway button. That covers the normal local-IP and local-DNS cases without any manual IP entry.

### Browser security: "requires HTTPS or localhost"

If you see:

> control ui requires HTTPS or localhost (secure context)
> disconnected (1008): control ui requires device identity

This means the browser is connecting over plain HTTP. **Solutions**:
- Set `access_mode` to **lan_https** (easiest — no external setup)
- Set `access_mode` to **lan_reverse_proxy** and use an HTTPS reverse proxy
- Use SSH port forwarding to `localhost` (desktop only)

### Unauthorized error

If the Gateway UI shows **Unauthorized**, re-check your token:

```sh
jq -r '.gateway.auth.token' /config/.hermes/config.yaml
```

> **Note**: Since Hermes v2026.2.22+ `hermes config get` redacts sensitive values — use `jq` to read directly from the config file.

## 5. Configuration Reference

### Model routing architecture

HomeOps AI is designed as a routed agent system rather than one slow all-purpose prompt. This is important on large Home Assistant installs with hundreds or thousands of entities.

| Lane | Best for | Typical model style | Context strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fast lane** | voice commands, state checks, entity classification | very fast tool-capable model such as `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast`, `qwen/qwen3.6-flash`, or tested `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | top matching entities only |
| **Complex lane** | diagnostics, logs, “why is this happening?” | stronger Hermes model | tool-driven retrieval |
| **Deep ops lane** | audits, repairs, planning, overnight analysis | strongest available model | asynchronous/background |

Recommended default is `agent_mode: router`. Avoid passing every Home Assistant entity to a model. Use retrieval and keep `max_fast_entities` low, usually 10–20. Groq or local OpenAI-compatible inference can be excellent for the fast lane, but only enable write/control use after tool-calling tests pass.

### The voice router (how the fast lane actually works)

When `agent_mode: router`, the add-on starts a loopback **voice router** on port `8643` speaking the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` protocol. Point your Home Assistant conversation integration (for example `extended_openai_conversation`) at `http://127.0.0.1:8643/v1` instead of the raw Hermes gateway.

Per utterance the router:

1. extracts the entity table Home Assistant embedded in the prompt,
2. scores every entity against what you said (names, aliases, domain keywords),
3. sends only the top `max_fast_entities` candidates to the fast-lane model,
4. attaches three on-demand tools — `search_entities`, `get_state`, `call_service` — so devices *not* in the candidate set are still reachable against the full entity graph,
5. escalates complex requests (diagnostics, automations, "why…", long messages, streaming) verbatim to the full Hermes gateway.

The router is fail-open: any router-side error escalates to the full agent rather than dropping your request. `call_service` stays disabled unless `enable_ha_service_calls` is on, and all entity/service names are strictly validated.

Health and live stats are on the add-on page under the **Voice** tab (fast vs escalated turns, entity diet, p50/p95 latency), or directly at `/router/health` and `/router/stats` via ingress. To self-test the routing logic offline, run `python3 scripts/dogfood_router.py` from a repo checkout.


All options are set via **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Configuration** in Home Assistant. They are applied automatically on each app restart.

### Gateway

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gateway_mode` | `local` / `remote` | `local` | **local**: run gateway in this add-on. **remote**: connect to an external gateway |
| `gateway_remote_url` | string | _(empty)_ | Remote gateway WebSocket URL used when `gateway_mode: remote` (example: `ws://192.168.1.20:18790` or `wss://gateway.example.com:443`) |
| `gateway_bind_mode` | `loopback` / `lan` / `tailnet` | `loopback` | **loopback**: 127.0.0.1 only (secure). **lan**: all interfaces (LAN-accessible). **tailnet**: Tailscale interface only. Only applies when `gateway_mode` is `local` |
| `gateway_port` | int | `18790` | Port for the gateway. Only applies when `gateway_mode` is `local` |
| `access_mode` | `custom` / `local_only` / `lan_https` / `lan_reverse_proxy` / `tailnet_https` | `custom` | **Simplifies secure access setup.** `custom`: use individual settings (backward-compatible). `lan_https`: built-in HTTPS proxy for LAN (recommended for phones). `lan_reverse_proxy`: external reverse proxy. `tailnet_https`: Tailscale. `local_only`: Ingress only. See [Accessing the Hermes Workspace](#4-accessing-the-gateway-web-ui) |
| `gateway_public_url` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional override for the "Open Hermes Workspace" button. In common local installs the add-on derives the URL automatically from the current Home Assistant host and access mode, so you can usually leave this empty. Set it when you need a different reverse-proxy, HTTPS, or Tailscale hostname. |
| `enable_openai_api` | bool | `false` | Enable the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Required for [Assist pipeline integration](#6c-assist-pipeline-integration-openai-api) |
| `gateway_auth_mode` | `token` / `trusted-proxy` | `token` | Gateway auth mode. Use `trusted-proxy` when terminating HTTPS in a reverse proxy and forwarding trusted auth headers. |
| `gateway_trusted_proxies` | string | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated trusted proxy IP/CIDR list used with `gateway_auth_mode: trusted-proxy`. |
| `gateway_additional_allowed_origins` | string | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated additional origins merged into `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` in `lan_https` mode (example: `https://ha.example.com:8443,capacitor://localhost`). |
| `controlui_disable_device_auth` | bool | `true` | Controls `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` in `lan_https` mode. **ON (recommended):** skip per-device pairing approval, avoid error 1008 on LAN HTTPS, token auth still required. **OFF:** enforce per-device pairing prompts (stricter, but more friction). |
| `disable_exec_approvals` | bool | `true` | Disable host exec approval prompts for unattended automations. This fork now enables that by default. When enabled, the add-on forces `/config/.hermes/exec-approvals.json` defaults to `security=full`, `ask=off`, `askFallback=full` and aligns `/config/.hermes/config.yaml` with `tools.exec.host=gateway`, `tools.exec.security=full`, `tools.exec.ask=off`, and `tools.exec.strictInlineEval=false`. Turn it OFF only if you explicitly want human approval prompts restored. |
| `force_ipv4_dns` | bool | `true` | Force IPv4-first DNS ordering for Node network calls. **Recommended ON** — most HAOS VMs lack IPv6 egress, causing `web_fetch` and Telegram timeouts. Set to `false` only if your network has working IPv6. |
| `gateway_env_vars` | list of `{name, value}` | `[]` | Environment variables exported to the gateway process at startup. UI format: list entries with `name` and `value` (example: `name=OPENAI_API_KEY`, `value=sk-...`). Limits: max 50 vars, key length 255, value length 10000. Reserved runtime keys are blocked (for example `PATH`, `HOME`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `NODE_PATH`, `HERMES_*`, proxy vars). Legacy string/object formats are still accepted for backward compatibility. |
| `nginx_log_level` | `full` / `minimal` | `minimal` | Nginx access log verbosity. `minimal` suppresses repetitive Home Assistant health-check and polling requests (`GET /`, `GET /v1/models`). `full` logs everything. |

When `gateway_auth_mode: trusted-proxy` is used, the add-on sets `gateway.auth.trustedProxy.userHeader` to `x-forwarded-user` by default.

### Terminal

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable_terminal` | bool | `true` | Show the web terminal on the add-on page |
| `terminal_port` | int | `7682` | Port for the terminal (ttyd). Change if 7682 conflicts. Range: 1024-65535 |

### Security & Tokens

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `homeassistant_token` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional HA long-lived access token (use at own risk, can be very unsecure but very powerful). Saved to `/config/secrets/homeassistant.token` for use by scripts/skills |
| `enable_builtin_ha_tools` | bool | `true` | Registers the add-on's built-in Home Assistant MCP server so Hermes can read live entities, devices, areas, automations, services, templates, and history through first-class tools. Recommended ON. |
| `enable_ha_service_calls` | bool | `false` | Exposes the mutating `ha_service_call` tool on top of the built-in Home Assistant tool layer. Leave OFF unless you want Hermes to call Home Assistant services after explicit user approval. |

| `domotz_api_key` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional Domotz API key for network inventory correlation. Stored in `/config/secrets/domotz.api_key`. |
| `domotz_site_id` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional Domotz site ID. Stored in `/config/secrets/domotz.site_id`. |
| `github_issues_token` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional fine-grained GitHub token with `Issues: write` for direct issue filing to `GitDakky/homeops-ai`. Stored in `/config/secrets/github_issues.token`. |
| `mqtt_broker_url` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional external MQTT broker URL such as `mqtt://broker.local:1883` or `mqtts://cluster.s2.eu.hivemq.cloud:8883`. Stored in `/config/secrets/mqtt.broker_url`. |
| `mqtt_username` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional MQTT username. Stored in `/config/secrets/mqtt.username`. |
| `mqtt_password` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional MQTT password. Stored in `/config/secrets/mqtt.password`. |
| `enable_matrix` | bool | `false` | Enable Matrix channel support from Home Assistant settings. When ON and a homeserver plus usable auth are configured, the add-on configures `channels.matrix` in Hermes and will try to ensure the Matrix plugin is installed. |
| `matrix_homeserver` | string | _(empty)_ | Matrix homeserver URL such as `https://matrix.example.org` or `http://matrix-synapse:8008` for a private Synapse deployment. |
| `matrix_allow_private_network` | bool | `false` | Allows private or internal Matrix homeservers on localhost, LAN, Tailscale, or internal hostnames. Turn ON for self-hosted Synapse/Dendrite installs. |
| `matrix_user_id` | string | _(empty)_ | Full Matrix user ID for the bot account, for example `@hermes:example.org`. |
| `matrix_access_token` | string | _(empty)_ | Preferred Matrix auth method. If set, the add-on writes `channels.matrix.accessToken` and ignores `matrix_password`. Stored in `/config/secrets/matrix.access_token`. |

| `matrix_encryption` | bool | `false` | Enable Matrix end-to-end encryption for the configured account. Leave OFF unless you explicitly want encrypted-room support and have tested the account/device flow. |
| `matrix_dm_policy` | `pairing` / `allowlist` / `open` / `disabled` | `pairing` | DM policy for Matrix. `pairing` is the safest default, `open` removes DM pairing friction, `allowlist` restricts DMs to approved users, and `disabled` blocks DMs. |
| `matrix_dm_allow_from` | string | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated Matrix user IDs allowed to DM the bot when `matrix_dm_policy: allowlist`. |
| `matrix_group_policy` | `open` / `allowlist` / `disabled` | `open` | Room policy for Matrix. `open` is the low-friction mode for ad-hoc room invites, `allowlist` restricts room replies to `matrix_room_allowlist`, and `disabled` blocks room traffic. |
| `matrix_group_allow_from` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional comma-separated Matrix user IDs allowed to trigger replies inside rooms. Leave empty to allow any user in an allowed room under the chosen room policy. |
| `matrix_room_allowlist` | string | _(empty)_ | Optional comma-separated Matrix room IDs allowed when `matrix_group_policy: allowlist` or `matrix_auto_join: allowlist`. |
| `matrix_auto_join` | `always` / `allowlist` / `off` | `always` | Invite auto-join policy. `always` lets users invite the bot into rooms without pre-whitelisting, `allowlist` only joins rooms in `matrix_room_allowlist`, and `off` disables auto-join entirely. |
| `enable_bacnet_scout` | bool | `false` | Enables BACnet/IP operator scaffolding and dashboard status. It does not silently probe the network by itself. |
| `enable_temporal` | bool | `false` | Enables the Temporal connector for durable long-running workflows and schedules. Requires `temporal_address`. |
| `temporal_address` | string | _(empty)_ | Temporal server gRPC address. Self-hosted: `host:7233`. Temporal Cloud: `<namespace>.<account>.tmprl.cloud:7233`. |
| `temporal_namespace` | string | `default` | Temporal namespace to operate in. |
| `temporal_api_key` | password | _(empty)_ | Temporal Cloud API key. Stored in `/config/secrets/temporal.api_key`. Leave empty for self-hosted clusters without API-key auth. |
| `temporal_tls_cert_path` | string | _(empty)_ | Path to an mTLS client certificate for self-hosted TLS clusters (place the file under the add-on config directory). |
| `temporal_tls_key_path` | string | _(empty)_ | Path to the matching mTLS client key. |
| `temporal_task_queue` | string | `homeops` | Default task queue name for HomeOps workflows. |
| `enable_airflow` | bool | `false` | Enables the Airflow connector for scheduled DAGs and batch pipelines. Requires `airflow_api_url`. |
| `airflow_api_url` | string | _(empty)_ | Airflow webserver base URL, e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:8080` (the REST API lives under `/api/v1`). |
| `airflow_username` | string | _(empty)_ | Airflow username for basic auth. |
| `airflow_password` | password | _(empty)_ | Airflow password for basic auth. Stored in `/config/secrets/airflow.password`. |
| `airflow_api_token` | password | _(empty)_ | Alternative bearer/JWT token auth. Stored in `/config/secrets/airflow.api_token`. |

### Router SSH

For skills or scripts that need SSH access to a router, firewall, or other network device:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `router_ssh_host` | string | _(empty)_ | Hostname or IP of the SSH target |
| `router_ssh_user` | string | _(empty)_ | SSH username |
| `router_ssh_key_path` | string | `/data/keys/router_ssh` | Path to the private key inside the container |

To provide the SSH key: place the private key file in the add-on config directory so it appears at the configured path inside the container. Set permissions: `chmod 600`. (use at own risk, can be very unsecure but very powerful)

### Maintenance

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clean_session_locks_on_start` | bool | `true` | Remove stale session lock files on startup (safe — only removes locks when gateway isn't running) |
| `clean_session_locks_on_exit` | bool | `true` | Remove session lock files on clean shutdown |
| `auto_configure_mcp` | bool | `false` | Legacy external MCP auto-registration path for users who still want to register Home Assistant's external MCP endpoint via `homeassistant_token`. Ignored when `enable_builtin_ha_tools` is enabled. |
---

## 6. Use Case Guides

### 6a. LAN Access Setup

This is the most common setup — accessing the Hermes Workspace from a browser on your local network (including phones and tablets).

> **Since Hermes v2026.2.21**, the Control UI requires a secure context (HTTPS or localhost). Use the `access_mode` option for easy setup.

#### Option 1 — Built-in HTTPS proxy (recommended)

1. Go to **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Configuration**
2. Set `access_mode`: **lan_https**
3. Restart the add-on
4. Click the **Open Hermes Workspace** button — it uses HTTPS automatically

**Phone/tablet (one-time):** Click **Download CA Certificate** on the landing page, then install it on your device for trusted access without browser warnings.

#### Option 2 — External reverse proxy

1. Go to **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Configuration**
2. Set these options:

| Option | Value |
|---|---|
| `access_mode` | **lan_reverse_proxy** |
| `gateway_trusted_proxies` | **127.0.0.1,192.168.88.0/24** |
| `gateway_public_url` | `https://<your-domain>` |

3. Configure your reverse proxy to forward HTTPS to `<HA-IP>:18790`
4. Restart the add-on

**Security note**: Always use HTTPS for Control UI access. The `lan_https` mode handles this automatically; for reverse proxy setups, ensure your proxy terminates TLS.

### 6b. Remote Gateway Mode

If you have an Hermes gateway running on a different machine (e.g., a more powerful server), you can configure this add-on to connect to it instead of running its own.

1. Set `gateway_mode`: **remote**
2. Set `gateway_remote_url` in add-on configuration (example: `wss://gateway.example.com:443`)
3. Restart the add-on

When `gateway_mode` is `remote`:
- The add-on does **not** start a local gateway process
- The add-on writes `gateway.remote.url` from `gateway_remote_url` on startup
- `gateway_bind_mode` and `gateway_port` are ignored
- The terminal and landing page still work normally
- You still need the remote gateway's auth token

### 6c. Assist Pipeline Integration (OpenAI API)

Hermes's Gateway exposes an **OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint** (`POST /v1/chat/completions`). This lets you use Hermes as a **conversation agent** in Home Assistant's Assist pipeline — enabling voice control, automations, and smart home commands.

There are two ways to connect it to Home Assistant:

---

#### Option 1 — Hermes Integration (recommended)

The **native Hermes integration** provides auto-discovery, a Lovelace chat card, voice mode, tool invocation services, and status sensors — all in one package.

**Step 1 — Enable the endpoint**

In the add-on configuration, set `enable_openai_api`: **true**, then restart.

Or via terminal:
```sh
hermes config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```

**Step 2 — Install the Hermes integration**

Via HACS:
1. In HACS, add as a custom repository:
   - Repository: `https://github.com/techartdev/homeops-aiIntegration`
   - Category: **Integration**
2. Install and restart Home Assistant

Or manually: copy `custom_components/hermes` from the repo into your HA config directory.

**Step 3 — Add the integration**

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Hermes**
3. If the addon is running locally, it will be **auto-discovered** — just click Submit
4. If connecting to a remote instance, fill in host, port, token, and SSL settings manually

Use these connection rules so the integration matches the add-on's real access model:

- **Same Home Assistant host + local gateway**: use auto-discovery or the local gateway details. This is the normal add-on path.
- **Same Home Assistant host + `lan_https`**: the integration still connects to the internal local gateway path. The HTTPS certificate flow is for browsers, not for the local HA integration.
- **Another Home Assistant instance or another machine**: use the actual reachable gateway host, port, token, and SSL settings. Do not use the Home Assistant ingress page URL.
- **`gateway_mode: remote` in this add-on**: connect the integration to the remote gateway itself, not to this add-on's ingress page.

**Step 4 — Set as conversation agent**

1. Go to **Settings → Voice Assistants**
2. Edit your assistant (or create a new one)
3. Under **Conversation agent**, select **Hermes**

**Step 5 — Expose entities**

Go to **Settings → Voice Assistants → Expose** and toggle on the entities you want Hermes to control.

#### Assist-first reliability baseline

For the first production-safe voice path, keep the setup boring and explicit:

1. Prefer the **native Hermes integration** over generic OpenAI wrappers when this add-on and Home Assistant are on the same host.
2. Turn on `enable_openai_api`, then restart the add-on before testing the assistant.
3. Expose only the entities you actually want voice control to touch.
4. Keep `enable_ha_service_calls` **OFF** unless you explicitly want the built-in Home Assistant tool layer to make service calls after approval.
5. If the integration is local, use auto-discovery or local connection details. Do not point Assist at the ingress page URL.
6. Treat browser HTTPS setup and Assist setup as separate concerns: `lan_https` matters for browsers, but the same-host integration still uses the local gateway path.

#### Capability expectations

- The strongest first-use case is deterministic Home Assistant control and question answering with explicitly exposed entities.
- Use the native integration when you want the Lovelace card, voice mode, sensors, and cleaner local wiring.
- Keep broad autonomous write behavior behind explicit approval and exposed-entity boundaries.
- Multi-channel outbound voice and call escalation are roadmap items, not current shipped behavior. See [VOICE_ESCALATION_POLICY.md](VOICE_ESCALATION_POLICY.md) and [JANUS_MEDIA_CONTROL_PLANE.md](JANUS_MEDIA_CONTROL_PLANE.md) for the planned boundary.

**Step 6 — Add the chat card (optional)**

The integration auto-registers a Lovelace card. Add it to any dashboard:
```yaml
type: custom:hermes-chat-card
```

The card includes message history, typing indicator, voice input, wake-word support, and TTS responses.

> **Works with standalone Hermes too.** The integration doesn't require the HA addon — it connects to any reachable Hermes gateway over HTTP/HTTPS. See the [integration README](https://github.com/techartdev/homeops-aiIntegration) for remote connection details.

---

#### Option 2 — Extended OpenAI Conversation (alternative)

If you prefer to use the [Extended OpenAI Conversation](https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation) integration instead:

**Prerequisites:**
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed on your Home Assistant

**Step 1 — Enable the endpoint**

In the add-on configuration, set `enable_openai_api`: **true**, then restart.

Or via terminal:
```sh
hermes config set gateway.http.endpoints.chatCompletions.enabled true
```

**Step 2 — Install Extended OpenAI Conversation**

1. In HACS, add as a custom repository:
   - Repository: `https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation`
   - Category: **Integration**
2. Install and restart Home Assistant

**Step 3 — Configure the integration**

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Extended OpenAI Conversation**
3. Configure:
   - **API Key**: your gateway token — run `jq -r '.gateway.auth.token' /config/.hermes/config.yaml` in the terminal
   - **Base URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:18790/v1`
   - **API Version**: leave empty
   - **Organization**: leave empty
   - **Skip Authentication**: **true**

> If using `gateway_bind_mode: lan`, you can also use `http://<your-ha-ip>:18790/v1` — this allows other HA instances on your network to connect too.

**Step 4 — Set as conversation agent**

1. Go to **Settings → Voice Assistants**
2. Edit your assistant (or create a new one)
3. Under **Conversation agent**, select **Extended OpenAI Conversation**

**Step 5 — Expose entities**

Go to **Settings → Voice Assistants → Expose** and toggle on the entities you want Hermes to control.

You can now use Assist (voice or text) and Hermes will handle conversations, control devices, answer questions, and create automations.

### 6d. Browser Automation (Chromium)

The add-on includes **Chromium** for browser-based automation tasks. Hermes can use it for web scraping, form filling, website testing, and other browser automation skills.

### 6d. Matrix channel

The add-on can provision Matrix directly from Home Assistant settings. This is the intended route if you want operators to invite Hermes into rooms without dropping into raw `hermes config` commands.

**Recommended low-friction setup**

1. In **Settings -> Apps -> HomeOps AI -> Configuration**
2. Set:

| Option | Value |
|---|---|
| `enable_matrix` | `true` |
| `matrix_homeserver` | `https://matrix.example.org` |
| `matrix_user_id` | `@hermes:example.org` |
| `matrix_access_token` | your bot token |
| `matrix_group_policy` | `open` |
| `matrix_auto_join` | `always` |
| `matrix_dm_policy` | `pairing` |

3. Restart the add-on

This is the practical workaround for Matrix's usual room whitelist friction:
- `matrix_group_policy: open` lets the bot respond in any joined room
- `matrix_auto_join: always` lets users invite the bot into new rooms ad hoc
- `matrix_dm_policy: pairing` keeps direct messages safer by default

**When to use allowlists instead**

Use these only if you want a tighter Matrix boundary:
- `matrix_dm_allow_from` for a direct-message allowlist
- `matrix_group_allow_from` for a room member allowlist
- `matrix_room_allowlist` plus `matrix_group_policy: allowlist` for a strict room list

**Private homeservers**

If your Matrix server is self-hosted on LAN/Tailscale/internal DNS:
- set `matrix_allow_private_network: true`

Without that, the add-on will refuse private homeserver targets for safety.

### 6d-mcp. Built-in Home Assistant tool layer

This add-on now ships with a **built-in Home Assistant MCP server** and enables it by default. That gives Hermes first-class access to live Home Assistant objects without requiring a manual MCP registration flow or separate long-lived token setup.

#### What the built-in tool layer exposes

- `ha_entities_list`
- `ha_entity_get`
- `ha_devices_list`
- `ha_device_get`
- `ha_areas_list`
- `ha_labels_list`
- `ha_floors_list`
- `ha_automations_list`
- `ha_automation_get`
- `ha_history_get`
- `ha_services_list`
- `ha_templates_render`
- `ha_service_call` only when `enable_ha_service_calls` is enabled

#### Security model

- Read-only Home Assistant access is enabled by default inside the trusted add-on context.
- Mutating service calls stay opt-in and require the `enable_ha_service_calls` option to be enabled.
- `ha_service_call` is intended for explicit user-approved actions, not silent background mutation.

#### Recommended setup

1. Leave **Enable Built-In Home Assistant Tools** (`enable_builtin_ha_tools`) turned **ON**
2. Restart the add-on after changing the option
3. Ask Hermes questions like:
   - _"What is the outside air temperature?"_
   - _"List all BACnet entities."_
   - _"Which entities are unavailable?"_
   - _"What is in the plant room area?"_
   - _"Show me automations touching heating."_

If those questions work without shell commands or file scraping, the built-in Home Assistant tool layer is active.

#### Live Home Assistant filesystem access

This fork also mounts the real Home Assistant configuration root into the add-on at:

```sh
/ha-config
```

Use `/ha-config` when you need to inspect or repair Home Assistant itself:

- `/ha-config/configuration.yaml`
- `/ha-config/secrets.yaml`
- `/ha-config/custom_components/`
- `/ha-config/packages/`
- `/ha-config/.storage/`

Keep the path split straight:

- `/config` is the add-on's persistent Hermes workspace and secret store.
- `/ha-config` is the live Home Assistant config tree.

Because this fork is intended as a trusted, high-capability Home Assistant operator, `/ha-config` is mounted writable by default. Treat edits there with the same care you would use when editing Home Assistant directly on disk.

#### Legacy external MCP path

The old `homeassistant_token` + `auto_configure_mcp` path still exists as a compatibility mode for people who want to register Home Assistant's external MCP endpoint manually. It is no longer the recommended path, and it is ignored when `enable_builtin_ha_tools` is ON.

To enable it, add to `/config/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "enabled": true,
    "headless": true,
    "noSandbox": true
  }
}
```

> **Note**: `noSandbox` is required inside Docker containers due to security namespace restrictions.

### 6e. Router / Network Device SSH

If you have skills or scripts that need SSH access to a router, firewall, or other network device:

1. Generate an SSH key pair (if you don't have one):
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /config/keys/router_ssh -N ""
   ```
2. Copy the public key to your router:
   ```sh
   cat /config/keys/router_ssh.pub
   ```
   Add it to the router's authorized keys.
3. Configure the add-on options:
   - `router_ssh_host`: your router's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
   - `router_ssh_user`: SSH username (e.g., `admin`)
   - `router_ssh_key_path`: `/config/keys/router_ssh` (or wherever you saved it)
4. Test from the terminal:
   ```sh
   ssh -i /config/keys/router_ssh admin@192.168.1.1
   ```

The connection details are also saved to `/config/CONNECTION_NOTES.txt` for reference by scripts.

### 6f. Google Sheets / Google APIs (gog OAuth)

Some Hermes skills use [gog](https://github.com/deftdawg/gog) to interact with Google APIs (Sheets, Drive, etc.). Because the add-on runs inside a container, the standard browser-based OAuth flow won't work — the localhost redirect can't reach your PC. Use the **manual** flow instead.

#### Step 1 — Prepare OAuth credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → **APIs & Services → Credentials**
2. Create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (type: **Web application**) or use an existing one
3. In the client's **Authorized redirect URIs**, add: `http://localhost:1`
4. Download the client JSON file and copy it into the add-on:
   ```sh
   # From your PC, copy the file to the HA config directory
   # Then in the add-on terminal:
   mkdir -p /config/secrets
   # Place the downloaded JSON as:
   /config/secrets/gmail_oauth_client.json
   ```

#### Step 2 — Register credentials with gog

```sh
gog auth credentials /config/secrets/gmail_oauth_client.json
```

This tells gog where to find your OAuth client configuration.

#### Step 3 — Authorize with `--manual`

```sh
gog auth add your-email@gmail.com --services sheets --manual
```

The `--manual` flag avoids the localhost redirect problem. gog will:

1. Print an authorization URL — **open it in your PC's browser**
2. Sign in with your Google account and grant access
3. You'll be redirected to a URL starting with `http://localhost:1?...` — the page will fail to load, **that's expected**
4. **Copy the full URL** from your browser's address bar
5. Paste it back into the add-on terminal when prompted
6. If prompted for a **passphrase**, enter one to encrypt the stored token (remember it — you'll need it if gog asks again)

#### Step 4 — Verify

```sh
gog auth list
```

You should see your account listed with the `sheets` service.

> **Why `--manual`?** The default OAuth flow starts a temporary HTTP server on localhost to receive the callback. Since the add-on runs on your HA device (not your PC), the browser redirect to `localhost` can't reach the add-on's server. The `--manual` flag skips the local server and lets you paste the redirect URL directly.

> **Persistence**: gog stores credentials under `/config/gogcli/` which is persistent storage — your auth survives add-on updates.

## 7. Data Persistence & Skills

### What persists across add-on updates

| Data | Location | Persists? |
|---|---|---|
| Hermes config | `/config/.hermes/config.yaml` | Yes |
| Built-in skills | `/config/.hermes/skills/` | Yes |
| Agent sessions & data | `/config/.hermes/agents/` | Yes |
| Hermes Skills workspace | `/config/homeops/` | Yes |
| Seeded workspace bootstrap files | `/config/homeops/*.md` | Yes |
| User-installed npm skills | `/config/.node_global/` | Yes |
| SSH keys | `/config/keys/` | Yes |
| Tokens | `/config/secrets/` | Yes |
| Lightweight system graph | `/config/.hermes/gitdakky-system-graph.sqlite3` | Yes |
| Homebrew & brew-installed tools | `/config/.linuxbrew/` | Yes (synced on startup) |
| gog OAuth credentials | `/config/gogcli/` | Yes |
| TLS certificates (lan_https) | `/config/certs/` | Yes (CA persists; server cert regenerated if IP changes) |
| Live Home Assistant config root | `/ha-config/` | Host-backed (the real HA config tree) |
| Hermes binary | `/usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/` | **No** — reinstalled from image |

### How built-in skills work

Hermes ships with premade skills (e.g., web search, file management). On each startup, the add-on:

1. Copies built-in skills from the image to `/config/.hermes/skills/`
2. Creates a symlink from the image path back to persistent storage
3. On subsequent boots, only newer files are synced (existing files are preserved)

This means built-in skills survive image rebuilds, and any customizations you make to skill files are preserved.

### GitDakky seeded workspace and skill pack

On first boot, this fork also seeds persistent operator files under `/config/homeops`:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `HEARTBEAT.md`
- `IDENTITY.md`
- `MEMORY.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `TOOLS.md`
- `USER.md`

It also seeds a Home Assistant-focused skill pack into `/config/.hermes/skills/` with guidance for:

- Home Assistant operations
- automations
- voice/Assist
- diagnostics
- file access
- network mapping
- research
- Domotz
- GitHub issue reporting
- MQTT
- BACnet

These files are created only if missing, so later restarts do not wipe your manual edits.

### Dashboard editing and runtime visibility

The ingress landing page now includes:

- a file editor for the seeded workspace files and bundled skill files
- live `hermes cron` scheduler visibility
- last-heartbeat visibility
- read-only operator insight cards for homeowner summary, energy pressure, system drift, predictive maintenance, and security posture
- integration status cards for Context7, Domotz, GitHub issue reporting, MQTT, BACnet, and MCP
- a `Memory` tab with a persistent house journal, first-pass doctor score, recent config/runtime changes, incident summaries, and a risk register
- system-graph metadata backed by SQLite at `/config/.hermes/gitdakky-system-graph.sqlite3`

The insight cards are intentionally advisory and read-only. They use the add-on's trusted Home Assistant API context plus local add-on settings to surface bounded operator actions instead of raw telemetry dumps.

The Home OS Memory store lives at `/config/.hermes/home-os-memory/`. The add-on keeps a structured `memory-state.json` for the dashboard and a human-readable `house-journal.md` so you can flick through what changed, what broke, and what still looks risky.

### Reporting bugs and feature requests directly from the add-on

If you want the assistant to open GitHub issues directly in this repository:

1. Create a fine-grained GitHub personal access token with **Issues: write** for `GitDakky/homeops-ai`.
2. Paste it into the add-on setting `github_issues_token`.
3. Restart the add-on.

After that, the assistant can use:

```sh
homeops-report-issue --title "Your title here" --labels "bug,home-assistant" --body-file /path/to/body.md
```

or the seeded repo issue reporter skill when you explicitly ask it to file a bug or feature request.

### How user-installed skills work

When you install a skill via the Hermes dashboard or `npm install -g`, the add-on redirects global npm installs to `/config/.node_global/`. This directory persists across updates.

The add-on also configures `pnpm` global directory to persistent storage at `/config/.node_global/pnpm/`.

### Homebrew-installed tools

Homebrew (Linuxbrew) and all brew-installed CLI tools (e.g., `gemini`, `aider`, `gh`, `bw`) are now **persisted** across add-on updates. On each startup, the add-on:

1. Syncs the image's Homebrew install to `/config/.linuxbrew/`
2. Creates a symlink from `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/` to the persistent copy
3. On subsequent boots, only newer files are synced (user-installed packages are preserved)

This means `brew install` packages survive image rebuilds.

---

## 8. Bundled Tools

The add-on image includes these tools, available in the terminal:

| Tool | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Git | `git` | Version control |
| Vim | `vim` | Text editor |
| Nano | `nano` | Text editor (beginner-friendly) |
| bat | `bat` (alias for `batcat`) | Syntax-highlighted `cat` |
| fd | `fd` (alias for `fdfind`) | Fast file finder |
| ripgrep | `rg` | Fast text search |
| curl | `curl` | HTTP client |
| jq | `jq` | JSON processor |
| Python 3 | `python3` | Scripting |
| Node.js 22 | `node` | JavaScript runtime |
| npm | `npm` | Node package manager |
| pnpm | `pnpm` | Fast Node package manager |
| Homebrew | `brew` | Package manager (optional — may not be available on all CPUs) |
| Chromium | `chromium` | Headless browser for automation |
| SSH | `ssh` | Remote access |
| homeops-cleanup | `homeops-cleanup` | Interactive disk space monitor & cache cleanup helper |

### homeops-cleanup

Run `homeops-cleanup` from the add-on terminal to see an overview of disk usage and
selectively clear caches that accumulate over time:

```
$ homeops-cleanup
```

The tool displays:

- **Disk usage** — total, used, available, and percentage for the overlay filesystem.
- **Cache sizes** — npm global cache, pnpm content store, Hermes data, Homebrew cellar, workspace, Python `__pycache__`, and `/tmp`.
- **Cleanup menu** — choose which caches to purge (npm, pnpm, pycache, tmp, all at once).

> **Note:** The add-on cannot prune Docker images directly. If disk space is
> critically low due to old Docker layers, SSH into the host and run
> `docker image prune -a` or `docker system prune`.

---

## 9. Updating & Backup

### Updating the add-on

Home Assistant checks for add-on updates automatically. When an update is available:

1. Go to **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI**
2. Click **Update**
3. The add-on will rebuild with the new image

**What happens during an update**:
- The container is destroyed and recreated from the new image
- Everything under `/config/` is preserved (config, skills, workspace, keys)
- Homebrew and brew-installed packages are preserved (synced to `/config/.linuxbrew/`)
- The Hermes binary is updated to the version in the new image
- This fork tracks Hermes by rebuilding the add-on image; `hermes update` inside the container is not the supported maintenance path because container-local package changes do not survive image replacement.

### Checking your version

The add-on version is shown on the add-on page in Home Assistant. To check the Hermes version:

```sh
hermes --version
```

The landing page inside the add-on also shows the bundled Hermes version from the image metadata.

### Maintenance posture

This fork is maintained as an image-pinned Home Assistant add-on, not as an in-container self-updater. Future Hermes bumps should update the pinned version in the add-on image, validate wrapper compatibility, and ship a new add-on release. See [MAINTENANCE.md](MAINTENANCE.md) for the exact bump workflow.

### Backup

Home Assistant's built-in backup system automatically includes add-on configuration data (`/config/`). This covers all persistent data: Hermes config, skills, workspace, keys, and tokens.

**To create a backup**: Go to **Settings → System → Backups → Create Backup**

**Manual backup** (from the terminal):
```sh
# Key paths to back up:
# /config/.hermes/     - Hermes config, skills, agent data
# /config/homeops/         - Hermes Skills workspace
# /config/.node_global/  - User-installed npm skills
# /config/keys/          - SSH keys
# /config/secrets/       - Tokens
```

### Factory reset

To reset the add-on to a clean state, remove the persistent data:

```sh
rm -rf /config/.hermes /config/homeops /config/.node_global
```

Then restart the add-on. It will re-bootstrap a fresh configuration.

> **Warning**: This deletes all your Hermes configuration, skills, and workspace data. Back up first if needed.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### How to read add-on logs

Go to **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Log** tab. Logs show startup messages, errors, and service status.

### Port 48109 conflict (add-on page won't load)

**Symptom**: `bind() to 0.0.0.0:48109 failed (98: Address already in use)` in logs.

**Cause**: A stale nginx process from a previous run is still holding the port. This can happen after a crash or unclean restart.

**Fix**: Restart the add-on. The startup script automatically cleans up stale processes. If the problem persists, stop the add-on, wait 10 seconds, then start it again.

### Port 7682 conflict (terminal won't load)

**Symptom**: `lws_socket_bind: ERROR on binding fd to port 7682` in logs.

**Fix**: Either restart the add-on (stale process cleanup), or change `terminal_port` to a different value (e.g., `7683`).

### ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

**Symptom**: Browser shows connection refused when opening the Hermes Workspace.

**Checks**:
1. Is the gateway running? In the terminal: `hermes gateway status`
2. Is the bind mode correct? `hermes config get gateway.bind` — must be `lan` for direct LAN access, or `loopback` if using `lan_https` mode
3. Is the port correct? `hermes config get gateway.port`
4. Is the firewall blocking the port? Check your HA host firewall rules

### "disconnected (1008): control ui requires device identity" / "requires HTTPS or localhost"

**Symptom**: Gateway UI shows error 1008 or "requires secure context / device identity".

**Cause**: Hermes v2026.2.21+ requires HTTPS or localhost. Plain HTTP over LAN is blocked. (v2026.2.22 further hardens this by defaulting remote onboarding to `wss://` and rejecting insecure non-loopback targets.)

**Fix** (pick one):
1. **Easiest**: Set `access_mode` to **lan_https** in add-on Configuration → restart. This adds a built-in HTTPS proxy with zero external setup.
2. **External proxy**: Set `access_mode` to **lan_reverse_proxy** and configure NPM/Caddy/Traefik with TLS.
3. **SSH tunnel** (desktop only): `ssh -L 18790:127.0.0.1:18790 user@ha-ip` then open `http://localhost:18790`.

### "disconnected (1008): origin not allowed"

**Symptom**: Gateway UI shows `origin not allowed (open the Control UI from the gateway host or allow it in gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins)`.

**Cause**: Hermes v2026.2.21+ checks the browser's `Origin` header against an allow-list. When using the built-in HTTPS proxy (`lan_https`), the origin (`https://<ip>:<port>`) must be registered in `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins`.

**Fix**: In **v0.5.50+** defaults are configured automatically on startup. In **v0.5.54+**, the add-on now merges defaults with existing values and user extras.
1. Restart the add-on (the startup script detects LAN IP and updates origins).
2. If needed, set `gateway_additional_allowed_origins` in add-on configuration (comma-separated), then restart.
3. If the IP has changed since you last started, restart again — the cert and defaults are refreshed.
4. **Manual override** (advanced, from the add-on terminal):
   ```sh
   hermes config set gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins '["https://192.168.1.10:18790"]'
   ```
   Then restart the add-on to re-merge defaults + extras.

### "disconnected (1008): pairing required"

**Symptom**: Gateway UI loads over HTTPS but shows `pairing required` and the status is Offline.

**Cause**: Hermes v2026.2.21+ requires new devices to complete a pairing handshake before the Control UI WebSocket is accepted. Loopback connections are auto-approved (v2026.2.22 further improves this with loopback scope-upgrade auto-approval), but LAN connections (including those through the HTTPS proxy) require explicit approval.

**Fix**: In **v0.5.50+** the add-on configures `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` in `lan_https` mode. By default it is enabled (`controlui_disable_device_auth: true`) to bypass per-device pairing while still enforcing token auth. If you prefer stricter behavior, set `controlui_disable_device_auth: false` and approve new devices manually.

### `unauthorized: gateway token mismatch`

**Symptom**: `hermes tui`, the Control UI, or `hermes gateway status` reports `unauthorized: gateway token mismatch`.

**Cause**: The gateway token stored in `/config/.hermes/config.yaml` changed, but the live runtime was still using an older in-memory token. This most commonly happens if onboarding or interactive config rewrites the gateway block while the add-on is already running.

**Fix**:
1. Use `homeops-onboard` and `homeops-configure` from the add-on terminal instead of raw `hermes onboard` / `hermes configure`.
2. In **v0.7.3+** the add-on also watches `hermes.json` for gateway changes and recycles the local runtime automatically, so post-onboarding token drift should self-heal.
3. If you still hit it on an older build, restart the add-on once so the runtime reloads the same token that is now on disk.

> **v2026.2.22 note:** The gateway now logs a security warning on startup when this flag is active. The warning is expected and harmless — run `hermes security audit` for details.

1. **Restart the add-on** — the startup script writes the config before launching the gateway.
2. If the error persists, set it manually:
   ```sh
   nano /config/.hermes/config.yaml
   ```
   Ensure `gateway.controlUi` contains:
   ```json
   "controlUi": {
     "dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth": true,
     "allowedOrigins": ["https://YOUR_IP:18790"]
   }
   ```
   Then restart the gateway: `hermes gateway restart`
3. Alternatively, approve devices individually without disabling auth:
   ```sh
   hermes devices list       # show pending pairing requests
   hermes devices approve <requestId>
   ```

### New agent says "No API key found for provider ..."

**Symptom**: After hatching or opening a new TUI session, the agent reports `No API key found for provider "anthropic"` (or another provider) and points at `agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`.

**Cause**: Current Hermes stores model credentials per-agent under `agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`. Older installs often kept auth and sessions in the legacy single-agent layout (`/config/.hermes/agent/` and `/config/.hermes/sessions/`).

**Fix**:
1. Restart the add-on once. This fork now reconciles legacy single-agent state into `agents/main/...` before the gateway starts.
2. If the warning persists, run:
   ```sh
   hermes doctor --non-interactive
   ```
3. If you still need to compare files manually, check:
   - legacy auth store: `/config/.hermes/agent/auth-profiles.json`
   - current auth store: `/config/.hermes/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`

### Automations keep stopping on exec approvals

**Cause**: Hermes host execution still honors exec approval policy even when the automation flow is otherwise configured correctly. For fully unattended automation, you must relax both layers together: `exec-approvals.json` defaults and `tools.exec` in `hermes.json`.

**Fix**:
1. In **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Configuration**, leave **Disable Exec Approval Prompts** (`disable_exec_approvals`) **ON**. This fork now defaults it to **ON**.
2. Restart the add-on
3. Verify in the embedded terminal:
   ```sh
   hermes approvals get
   ```
4. The defaults row should show:
   ```text
   security=full, ask=off, askFallback=full
   ```

This add-on writes the policy to:
- `/config/.hermes/exec-approvals.json`
- `/config/.hermes/config.yaml` with `tools.exec.host=gateway`, `tools.exec.security=full`, `tools.exec.ask=off`, and `tools.exec.strictInlineEval=false`

> **Warning**: This disables host exec approval prompts and weakens safety guardrails. Use it only on trusted Home Assistant installs where unattended automation is intentional.
4. Restart the add-on and hatch the TUI again.

### Local TUI says "pairing required" after hatch

**Symptom**: The local TUI connects, but operator actions or local command execution fail with `gateway closed (1008): pairing required`.

**Fix**:
1. Restart the add-on once so the new same-host pairing helper is active.
2. Retry the TUI session.
3. If you still see it, inspect and approve pending requests manually:
   ```sh
   hermes devices list --json
   hermes devices approve --latest
   ```

### Gateway UI shows "Unauthorized"

**Fix**: Get the correct token and use it:

```sh
jq -r '.gateway.auth.token' /config/.hermes/config.yaml
```

> **Note**: Since Hermes v2026.2.22+ `hermes config get` redacts sensitive values (returns `hermes_redacted`). Use `jq` to read the token directly from the config file.

Paste this token when the UI prompts for authentication, or append it to the URL: `http://<ip>:18790/?token=<your-token>`

### "Open Hermes Workspace" points to the wrong place or stays disabled

**Symptom**: The button opens the wrong host, opens nothing useful, or changes to **Configure Gateway URL**.

**Cause**: The add-on only derives the browser URL automatically for the common local cases. Reverse-proxy, Tailscale, and remote-gateway setups need the browser-facing URL spelled out explicitly.

**Fix**:
1. Leave `gateway_public_url` empty for normal local installs where Home Assistant and the browser already agree on the host.
2. For reverse proxy or Tailscale access, set `gateway_public_url` to the final browser-facing `https://...` URL and restart.
3. For `gateway_mode: remote`, keep `gateway_remote_url` as the backend `ws://` or `wss://` endpoint and set `gateway_public_url` separately to the remote Control UI `http://` or `https://` URL if you want the button to open it.
4. Do not reuse a websocket URL in `gateway_public_url`.

### Companion integration cannot connect when pointed at the add-on page

**Symptom**: The integration works poorly or not at all when configured with the Home Assistant add-on page URL.

**Cause**: The Home Assistant ingress page is the operator surface. It is not the direct gateway endpoint the integration should use.

**Fix**:
1. If the integration is on the same HA host as this add-on, use auto-discovery or the local gateway path.
2. If the integration is on another HA instance or machine, use the actual reachable gateway host, port, token, and SSL settings.
3. If this add-on is in `gateway_mode: remote`, point the integration at the remote gateway itself.

### CLI shows unauthorized with `trusted_proxy_user_missing`

**Symptom**: In add-on terminal, commands that open direct gateway WebSocket (for example some `hermes status`/gateway probes) fail with unauthorized and logs mention `trusted_proxy_user_missing`.

**Cause**: `gateway_auth_mode: trusted-proxy` expects identity headers from your reverse proxy. Direct local CLI connections are not proxied, so they may be rejected.

**What to do**:
- Keep `trusted-proxy` for browser traffic via your reverse proxy.
- For local terminal workflows that require direct gateway auth, temporarily switch to `gateway_auth_mode: token` (or run via proxy path that injects trusted headers), then switch back if needed.

### Terminal not visible

1. Check that `enable_terminal` is **true** in the add-on configuration
2. Check logs for `Starting web terminal (ttyd)` — if missing, the terminal is disabled
3. If you see a port conflict error, change `terminal_port` to a different value

### `web_fetch failed: fetch failed` / HTTP tool calls time out

**Symptom**: Hermes's `web_fetch` tool (or any outbound HTTP call from a skill) fails with `fetch failed`.

**Cause**: Node 22 uses `autoSelectFamily` which tries IPv6 first. Most HAOS VMs have IPv6 DNS resolution but no IPv6 egress, so connections time out before falling back to IPv4.

**Fix**: Ensure `force_ipv4_dns` is **true** (default since v0.5.51). If you upgraded from an older version, the option may still be set to `false` — change it to `true` in **Settings → Apps → HomeOps AI → Configuration** and restart.

### Telegram network errors (`TypeError: fetch failed` / `getUpdates` fails)

If Telegram is configured but polling fails with network fetch errors:

1. In add-on terminal, test IPv4 vs IPv6 explicitly:
   ```sh
   curl -4 https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getMe
   curl -6 https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getMe
   ```
2. If IPv4 works but default/IPv6 fails, ensure add-on option `force_ipv4_dns` is `true` (default) and restart.
3. Keep `channels.telegram.network.autoSelectFamily: false` (default on Node 22).
4. If still failing, check host/VM IPv6 routing and DNS configuration.

### Outbound proxy not applied

**Symptom**: External API/network calls still fail in restricted networks even after setting proxy.

**Checks**:
1. Set add-on option `http_proxy` with full URL format: `http://host:port` (example: `http://192.168.2.1:3128`).
2. Restart the add-on after changing configuration.
3. Check logs for `INFO: Outbound HTTP/HTTPS proxy enabled from add-on configuration.`
4. If you see `WARN: Invalid http_proxy value`, fix the URL format and restart.

When proxy is enabled, add-on startup also applies default bypass ranges via `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` for localhost and private network ranges.

### Skills disappearing after update

Built-in skills are synced to persistent storage on each startup. If skills are missing:

1. Check logs for `INFO: Synced built-in skills to persistent storage` — this confirms the sync ran
2. If you see `WARN: Built-in skills directory not found`, the Hermes installation may be corrupted. Try reinstalling the add-on.
3. User-installed skills (via dashboard) are stored in `/config/.node_global/` and should survive updates

### Homebrew errors / CPU compatibility

**Symptom**: `Homebrew's x86_64 support on Linux requires a CPU with SSSE3 support!`

**Cause**: Your CPU doesn't support SSSE3 instructions (required by Homebrew). Affects older Intel Atom, Celeron, or pre-2006 processors.

**Impact**: Skills that depend on Homebrew-installed CLI tools (e.g., `gemini`, `aider`) won't work. Core Hermes functionality is unaffected.

**Workarounds**:
- Use a machine with a newer CPU (Intel Core 2 or newer, ~2006+)
- Install the required CLI tools manually if possible
- Use alternative skills that don't require Homebrew dependencies

### "hermes: command not found"

The Hermes binary should be installed at `/usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/`. If this error appears:

1. Check the add-on logs for npm installation errors during build
2. Try restarting the add-on
3. If the problem persists, uninstall and reinstall the add-on

### Gateway won't start / config errors

**Symptom**: `ERROR: Failed to apply gateway settings` in logs.

**Fix**: The `hermes.json` config file may be corrupted. To reset it:

```sh
rm /config/.hermes/config.yaml
```

Restart the add-on — it will generate a fresh config. You'll need to run `homeops-onboard` again.

### Disk space running low / "no space left on device"

**Symptom**: Build or startup fails, or the landing page shows a red disk-usage indicator.

**Cause**: Old Docker images and container layers accumulate on the host. Each add-on rebuild (~1–2 GB) keeps the previous image until pruned.

**Fix (from inside the add-on)**:
1. Open the terminal and run `homeops-cleanup` to clear npm/pnpm caches, pycache, and temp files.

**Fix (from the host)** — you need a **root shell on the HAOS host**, not the `ha` CLI
(the `ha docker` command does **not** support `prune`):

*Option A — Advanced SSH & Web Terminal add-on (easiest):*
1. Install the **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal** add-on from the HA store.
2. In its Configuration, **disable Protection Mode** (required for host-level access).
3. Open the terminal and run:
   ```sh
   docker image prune -a       # remove all unused images
   docker builder prune -a      # remove build cache
   ```

*Option B — HAOS debug console (VirtualBox / physical):*
1. On the HAOS console (keyboard/VirtualBox window), type `login` to get a root shell.
2. Run the same `docker image prune -a` and `docker builder prune -a` commands.

> **Note:** The `ha docker` CLI (shown by `ha docker --help`) only exposes `info`,
> `options`, and `registries` — it cannot prune images. You must use the raw `docker`
> command from a host root shell.

**Prevention**: If running HAOS in VirtualBox, resize the VDI to at least 64 GB:
```
VBoxManage modifymedium disk haos.vdi --resize 64000
```

## 11. FAQ

**Does this work on Raspberry Pi?**
Yes. The add-on supports aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 4/5) and armv7 (Raspberry Pi 3). Note that Homebrew may not work on all ARM devices, but core functionality is unaffected.

**Can I run multiple agents?**
Hermes supports multiple agent profiles. Configure them via `homeops-configure` or by editing `/config/.hermes/config.yaml`. The gateway serves all configured agents.

**Can I use a remote gateway?**
Yes. Set `gateway_mode` to `remote` and set `gateway_remote_url` in add-on configuration. The add-on syncs it into Hermes config automatically. See [Remote Gateway Mode](#6b-remote-gateway-mode).

**How do I change the AI model or provider?**
Run `homeops-configure` in the terminal to reconfigure your AI providers, or edit `/config/.hermes/config.yaml` directly. You can use OpenAI, Google (Gemini), Anthropic (Claude), local models, and more.

**Can other devices on my network use the Hermes API?**
Yes. Set `access_mode` to `lan_https` (recommended) or `lan_reverse_proxy`. Any device on your network can connect to `https://<ha-ip>:18790`. Use the gateway token for authentication. This also enables the [Assist pipeline integration](#6c-assist-pipeline-integration-openai-api) from other HA instances or standalone Hermes integrations.

**Where is my data stored on the host?**
The add-on's `/config/` directory maps to `/addon_configs/<slug>/` on the Home Assistant host. This is included in HA backups automatically.

The add-on also mounts the live Home Assistant config root at `/ha-config`. That is where `configuration.yaml`, `secrets.yaml`, `custom_components/`, `packages/`, and `.storage/` live inside the container.

The add-on also mounts Home Assistant `/share` and `/media` as writable paths inside the container (`/share`, `/media`) for file access workflows. These are separate from both Hermes's persistent workspace under `/config` and the live HA config tree under `/ha-config`.
